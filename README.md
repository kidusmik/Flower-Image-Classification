# Flower Image Classification

This project trains an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. This can be used in something as a phone app that tells you the name of the flower the camera is looking at. In practice the classifier will be trained, then exported for use in an application. I will be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.


The project is broken down into multiple steps:

- Loading and preprocessing the image dataset
- Training the image classifier on the dataset
- Using the trained classifier to predict image content
